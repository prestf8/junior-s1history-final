"},{q:"Why did you immigrate here? (Added because he was an immigrant)",purpose:"The purpose of this question is to see the perspective of an immigrant who actually WANTED to go to America. Was it the push factors or possibly the pull factors?",response:"His home was very dirty and didn't even have seats for toilets. His house was too small and he didn't have much freedom in China. Another reason was that he couldn't go to college in China but could go to college in America. "},{q:"How do you regularly involve yourself in American culture",purpose:"The purpose of this question is so I could see how and how often the interviewee embraces American culture.  If the interviewee is an immigrant, then I could see if he attempts to incorporate American culture into his culture. ",response:"He says he has a Facebook account and occasionally watches the news. But most of the time he watches Chinese platforms. He also said he tried really hard to learn English in college.

Is it too much or too little freedom compared to other countries?",purpose:"America is pretty different because the first amendment allows citizens to have lots of freedom. The purpose of this question is to get the perception of another American to see if he believes that America’s first amendment is too overpowering or too weak.",response:"He hardly had any freedom in China and one of the reasons he went to America was because of freedom. He really enjoys the freedom here."},{q:"What languages do you speak in your household?",purpose:"For immigrants, the purpose of this question is to see whether they use their mother tongue or attempted to incorporate English into their ways of communication as an American. For people who were born here, the purpose of this question is to see whether they made the choice to speak English (which they should probably know) or decide to learn and speak a language which was more comfortable with their family / more related to their culture.

"},{q:"What do you think of America’s type of government?",purpose:"The type of government of any country is a good representation and factor of that country. Therefore, the purpose of this question is to really understand the perspective of an American on democracy.

Embracing the type of government in America is probably one of the possible answers for “What does it mean to be an American?”",response:"He really likes the type of government in America compared to China's government because it gives him a lot more freedom and rights."},{q:"Do you believe that American citizens make a lot of decisions for themselves / are independent?",purpose:"Independence is actually a huge pull factor in America and probably one of the most desired values of a country. Therefore, the purpose of this question is to see whether or not independence is significant enough to the interviewee in which he believes that American citizens are truly independent. If not, then I would know that independence isn’t one of the reasons why the interviewee likes America.",response:"He says that American people make more decisions and have more freedom than the people of China. He said he could do a lot more here than when he was in China."},{q:"Finally, What do you think it means to classify yourself as an American?",purpose:"This question is going to be asked to get an idea on what the interviewee thinks about the main question.",response:"He thinks that you should be an American when you don't travel illegally and get a citizenship."}],e}return i}(l["b"]);h=Object(c["a"])([l["a"]],h);var u=h,d=u,m=(i("3ded"),i("2877")),p=Object(m["a"])(d,a,s,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=p.exports},"75b7":function(e,t,i){},"7cbd":function(e,t,i){"use strict";i("75b7")},bd60:function(e,t,i){},cde9:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/interviewee.890c7761.png"},d22c:function(e,t,i){"use strict";i.r(t);var a=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement;e._self._c;return e._m(0)},s=[function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,i=e._self._c||t;return i("div",{attrs:{id:"historical-figure"}},[i("section",{staticClass:"historical-figure__intro"},[i("div",{staticClass:"historical-figure__black-layer"}),i("section",{staticClass:"historical-figure__content"},[i("h2",{staticClass:"historical-figure__name"},[e._v("Nikola Tesla")]),i("p",{staticClass:"historical-figure__role"},[e._v("Serbian-American Inventor and Engineer")])])]),i("main",{staticClass:"historical-figure__main-content-container"},[i("section",{staticClass:"historical-figure__main-content"},[i("h3",{staticClass:"historical-figure__main-content-title"},[e._v(" Facts ")]),i("div",{staticClass:"historical-figure__main-content-points"},[i("p",{staticClass:"historical-figure__point"},[e._v("- Born in Smiljian, Croatia on 1856")]),i("p",{staticClass:"historical-figure__point"},[e._v("- After graduating at Polytechnic Institute in Austria, he spent the next six years thinking about possible inventions and electromagnetic fields")]),i("p",{staticClass:"historical-figure__point"},[e._v("- In 1884, Tesla moved to New York City with very little money and wealth")]),i("p",{staticClass:"historical-figure__point"},[e._v("- Also arrived with a letter of introduction from Charles Bachelor to Thomas Edison")]),i("p",{staticClass:"historical-figure__point"},[e._v("- Tesla then would get hired by Edison")]),i("p",{staticClass:"historical-figure__point"},[e._v("- Designed the alternative-current (AC) electrical system which we still use today")]),i("p",{staticClass:"historical-figure__point"},[e._v("- Edison would receive his American citizenship in 1891")]),i("p",{staticClass:"historical-figure__point"},[e._v("- Earned many US patents and benefited America with many of his ideas and inventions")]),i("p",{staticClass:"historical-figure__point"},[e._v("- Tesla's contributions have greatly accelerated American innovation in the early 1900s")]),i("p",{staticClass:"historical-figure__point"},[e._v("- Discoveries by Tesla greatly impact America and even the world today")])])])])])}],n=i("d4ec"),o=i("262e"),r=i("2caf"),c=i("9ab4"),l=i("60a3"),h=function(e){Object(o["a"])(i,e);var t=Object(r["a"])(i);function i(){return Object(n["a"])(this,i),t.apply(this,arguments)}return i}(l["b"]);h=Object(c["a"])([Object(l["a"])({components:{}})],h);var u=h,d=u,m=(i("7cbd"),i("2877")),p=Object(m["a"])(d,a,s,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=p.exports}}]);
